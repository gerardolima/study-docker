study-docker
============
This is a personal repository for studies on docker, docker-composer and orcherstators.

The idea for this repository began when I found the [Haufe Docker Styleguide](https://haufe-lexware.gitbooks.io/haufe-group-docker-book-startup-guide/content/?q=) and realized some bits missing on my understanding about mostly orchestration, but also about containerizarion best practices. Since this guide builds up on their professional experience, I though it would be a good guide to deepen into these matters.
